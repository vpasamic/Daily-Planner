# Daily-Planner
This daily planner updates every second to check the time and hour of the day.  If the hour has already passed, the background color of the input row automatically turns to dark grey. A red background denotes the current hour, and a green background indicates future hours. This was done using a combination of moment.js and jquery.

Another function of the website is the storage of current tasks locally in localStorage. Using Jquery to target the id's of specific rows and save buttons made this function easy to do.
